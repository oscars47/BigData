# Project 1: Predicting MNIST digits using direct algorithm

## 2/21/24
* testing out idea to run cut and fit on all digits to see how the digit maps to distribution of chi2 maps
** massively increased computational speed
** ran total num 1000 and 10000
** result illustrates clear relationship between chi2red of L,R and digit identity, which suggests we can determine digit placement by these statistics
* realized sometimes we cut at the very last index, so because of that considering combined L and R chi2
* strategy of closest difference: 0.2746 accuracy... see confusion matrix
* if we only compared 0 to 1, got accuracy of 0.93235
* what if we used multiple cuts? say take initial 2, then split 2 into 2 each for total of 4: 0 vs 1 accuracy increases to 0.988, but with other digits decreases to 0.272
* added code for medial axis-- will work on this for later:
    That is to use the algorithm to connect nearest point from the current point to the next. Then find angles of two consecutive vectors of P1 to P2, and P2 to P3, if the angle is too large above certain threshold then stop and cut. Thanks 

    We will try to use this method to iteratively achieve better results and make each piece to have a function representation. Then study its deformations and define equivalent classes.

* what gu wants:
    Please cut each digit to the top and bottom pieces. Then click a piece is linear you donâ€™t need to transfer to polor coordinates. 

    To decide whether that piece is linear or not, just use linear regression 

    The goal is to represent a digit only by a few curve pieces that the computer can understand each piece which can be represented by a mathematical function. 

    Key is to make a thick stroke to a very thin curve which can be written as a function 

* what we're doing:
    considering only 0 and 1 digits for now,

    creating parameter of where to cut--based on number of points in that slice? for now just make it a hyperparam.
    
    fit line through the points in each section and plot residuals.

* added ```find_cut_fit_line``` and ```find_sig_max_density_x``` to plot_polar.py to perform the cutting based on finding maximum density slicing along x axis (only selected if max density - min density > threshold, otherwise use x center), and then fit to a line in each section and compute chi2red. we find chi2red dist is quite different whether digit is 0 (basically 0) and 1 (between 0.5-1) --- we wrote ```benchmark_0_1``` to test this.

## 2/13/24
* added mnist_2.py, which standardizes images by finding a bounding box, rescaling, performing PCA to rotate the images
* in plot_polar.py, applies standardization from mnist_2.py and then converts all the positions to polar coordinates.

## 2/12/24
* added mnist_idea.py, which creates networks by dividing the images into grids and then assinging nodes and edges based on if neighboring nodes were adjacent in terms of their bounding boxes.
